abstract = {This paper concerns the combustion in a reactive packed bed of oil shales grains. In order to predict impact of many parameters on fixed bed combustion of Timahdit oil shales (Morocco), a transient one dimensional numerical tool was designed. The possible thermal disequilibrium between solid and gas phase revealed in previous studies has been treated using a two phases heat balance equation, one for the gas and the other for the solid. Chemical analysis coming from series of experiments performed in Rapsodee Lab. (Albi, France) were used to determine a coal model considering pyrolysis producing char which is oxidized using the oxygen conveyed by the air flow. The sensitivity of the model to the speed injection is analyzed in this paper. The development of a 2D numerical tool will be also presented to show the importance of thermal heat lossesexisting on the walls and their consequence on the reactive front propagations.},

abstract = {This study evaluates two common methods to represent landslide polygons as frequencies for use within GIS analysis. These methods are used to extract information from factor maps, such as a single value for slope angle for the landslide polygon, which is then used in hazard assessment. Understanding the errors associated with generating points to represent landslide polygons should be clearly understood to evaluate the effectiveness of these points. In this paper, the effectiveness of two representation techniques in gathering slope angle information is examined. The first technique evaluated is based on the centroid (a point feature) of each landslide polygon. The value of the landslide factor class beneath the centroid point, e.g. the slope value at that point, selects the landslide factor class. The second method is an area based technique which depends on the area covered by different landslide factor classes, e.g. the most common slope for the polygon. Here, the landslide factor class that occupies most of the landslide polygon is selected as the attribute for each landslide polygon. As demonstrated in this paper, the results favour the area based technique. While this paper explores this technique for slope information, the finding is applicable to other landslide causal factors, such as elevation and rock type.},

abstract = {The scope of this review is to highlight the potential contributions of solar energy in meeting the energy requirements of the oil and gas industry. It includes an assessment of the key factors that impact the world energy scene and the anticipated role of solar energy up to 2035. It appears that oil and gas will continue to play a dominant role in meeting world energy demand over the next two decades, accounting for nearly 60{\%} of total primary energy, and reaching around 9960Mtoe in 2035. The energy consumption of the oil and gas industries is nearly 10{\%} of its total energy production and is expected to grow to a higher value with the growth of the share of unconventional oil and gas resources. The amounts of energy projected to be consumed by the oil and gas industry is estimated to be at least 39.4EJ by 2035. The energy supply to meet the demand of the oil and gas industry is based mostly on hydrocarbon energy sources, which leads to high levels of ecological footprints. Solar energy utilization within the industry will reduce its fossil fuels consumption, and therefore reduce its ecological footprints. Specifically, solar energy will help the industry in meeting part of its energy requirements in locations where conventional fuels, such as natural gas, are limited. This paper reviews various efforts made in developing solar technologies to suit the oil and gas industry. It also shows that some upstream oil and gas industries have already utilized solar energy in demonstration field applications. The review concludes that the application of solar energy in the oil and gas industry presents a very good opportunity for future business of the renewable energy industry. These opportunities includes the use of photovoltaic and solar thermal technologies.},

abstract = {One of the various problems which mankind faces as it enters into the 21st century is the problem of waste disposal management. Since polymeric materials do not decompose easily, disposal of waste polymers is a serious environmental problem. Large amounts of rubbers are used as tires for aeroplanes, trucks, cars, two-wheelers etc. But after a long run when these tires are not serviceable and discarded, only a few grams or kilograms of rubber ({\textless}1{\%}) are abraded out from the tire. Almost the entire amount of rubber from the worn out tires is discarded, which again need very long time for natural degradation due to crosslinked structure of rubbers and presence of stabilizers and other additives. This poses two major problems: the wastage of valuable rubber and the disposal of waste tires leading to environmental pollution. Two major approaches to solve this problem are the recycle and the reuse of used and waste rubber, and the reclaim of rubber raw materials.},

@article{Aldushin1999,
abstract = {The ability of energy to be concentrated in the front of a coflow (forward) filtration combustion (FC) wave in a porous solid is analyzed. Combustion is due to the exothermic reaction between the fuel in the porous solid and oxidizer contained in the gas flowing through the solid. Coflow filtration refers to the fact that the gaseous oxidizer flows to the reaction site through the product region, so that energy accumulation occurs due to the recovery of heat stored in the product. The gas flowing through the burned region transfers heat from the product region to the reaction site, and, even more importantly to the unburned fuel region. This results, primarily in preheating the fresh mixture, and consequently in strong overheating of the reaction zone where the temperature far exceeds the thermodynamic combustion temperature. This is the superadiabatic effect. The paper focuses on the mode of FC wave propagation corresponding to the most pronounced superadiabatic effect. We show that for this case, in the absence of heat losses, the temperature grows as √l where l is the distance traveled by the reaction front. The ratio l(T)/l, where l(T) is the width of the high temperature zone into which the energy is gathered, decreases as l(- 1/2 ), showing that the efficiency of energy accumulation increases as the wave propagates. In addition, it was previously shown that there exist both reaction leading and reaction trailing traveling wave (TW) structures, which occur when a parameter $\delta$, which is proportional to the ratio of the specific heats of the gas and solid and to the ratio of the initial concentrations of the solid fuel and the gaseous oxidizer, is greater than or less than 1, respectively. The case $\delta$ = 1 which separates the two structures corresponds to the most pronounced superadiabatic effect, and to a combustion temperature T(b) which is infinite. Thus, the TW analysis breaks down when $\delta$ = 1, indicating that TW solutions are no longer possible. For this case ($\delta$ = 1) we therefore investigate the full time-dependent problem to determine the structure of the FC wave, to determine whether T(b) actually becomes infinite and if so, its rate of approach to infinity. Though the combustion temperature in a FC wave experiment is, in fact, bounded, the ratio (T(b) - T(o))/q may be extremely large. Here, q, which characterizes the effect of the caloricity of the medium, is small when either the amount of fuel in the solid or the heat release in the reaction, is small. Thus, for any given q, no matter how small, FC wave propagation can always be realized by enhancing the energy accumulation. Heat losses to the environment bound the temperature growth at a level depending on the rate of heat exchange with the environment and the rate of incoming gas flux. Increasing the heat loss above the critical level causes extinction. The extinction limit may be overcome by increasing the gas influx.},

abstract = {Ulva lactuca (commonly known as sea letuce) is a green sea weed which dominates Green Tides or algae blooms. Green Tides are caused by excess nitrogen from agriculture and sewage outfalls resulting in eutrophication in shallow estuaries. Samples of U. lactuca were taken from the Argideen estuary in West Cork on two consecutive years. In year 1 a combination of three different processes/pretreatments were carried out on the Ulva. These include washing, wilting and drying. Biomethane potential (BMP) assays were carried out on the samples. Fresh Ulva has a biomethane yield of 183LCH4/kgVS. For dried, washed and macerated Ulva a BMP of 250LCH4/kgVS was achieved. The resource from the estuary in West Cork was shown to be sufficient to provide fuel to 264 cars on a year round basis. Mono-digestion of Ulva may be problematic; the C:N ratio is low and the sulphur content is high. In year 2 co-digestion trials with dairy slurry were carried out. These indicate a potential increase in biomethane output by 17{\%} as compared to mono-digestion of Ulva and slurry.},

abstract = {An ECBM (Enhanced Coal Bed Methane as evolution of CBM techniques) pre-feasibility study started for the Sulcis Coal Province in December 2004 on the basis of the experience gathered: 1) by INGV, from ongoing and past projects dealing with CO2 geological storage, i.e., Weyburn test-field (Canada) by EOR techniques and from the studies of “CO2 analogues” in Italy; 2) by the coal industry of the Sulcis Province (Sotacarbo S.p.A. {\&} Carbosulcis S.p.A.); 3) by ETH – Zurich, specifically on the coal adsorption properties, and 4) by IES S.r.l. reservoir engineering and gas storage industrial activity. This paper discusses the state of art of the project in the frame of the worldwide ECBM projects as a whole, on the basis of the yet acquired information and available experimental data. Environmental impact considerations are highlighted on the basis of the available Italian legal tools, giving hints for future EU, Italian and new regional legislation and strategies. A new concept of CO2 as “no waste” product in the coal/hydrocarbons provinces for ECBM/EOR exploitation is depicted, defining CO2 a “ natural climate- alterant factor”. Geochemical, structural-geology, stratigraphic and reservoir engineering considerations are discussed. The first newly gathered experimental data, including CO2/CH4 coal adsorption capacity data are showed, even if they are preliminary. Starting from the geological and logistical available data, a MapInfo GIS structure was built up, to be jointed later to other EC “CO2 storage” data-GIS as the GETSCO EC project structure. The most important objective of this Phase I is the selection of the best for a ECBM test-pilot site, which will be followed (Phase II) by scaled up site and possibly by a future network (Phase III); these phases are foreseen to be accompanied by the selection of the progressively addedCO2 industrial sources (inserted in the Map-info GIS) to be used within the project economic spreadsheet model. CO2 geological storage in Sardinia is evaluated as a whole, considering the seismotectonic framework and the CO2 industrial sources available or foreseen in the next years.},

abstract = {The problem of energy concentration in combustion waves is considered. On the example of natural flames with an energy excess it is shown these flames can exist in various systems and different combustion regimes. The existence of some flames such as cellular and spin itself is due to an excess energy. The mechanisms of energy concentration are also varied. Besides the heat exchange processes such as conduction, convection, radiation the mass exchange processes, filtration, phase transformations and compressibility of gas may participate in the energy concentration. Although the phenomenon itself is known for a long time but its properties, characteristics and peculiarities are insufficiently studied. On the other hand, the given examples of flames with artificially created conditions for energy concentration demonstrate the wide applicability of this phenomenon. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper describes the numerical investigations of the influence of the blending method on the combustion characteristics and NOx emission in a 500 MW, tangentially coal-fired boiler. The in-furnace and out-furnace blending methods are simulated with the blend of 60{\%} bituminous and 40{\%} subbituminous coals on a weight basis. The simulation shows the blending method has a great effect on carbon in ash, but a little effect on NOx emission. The in-furnace blending method which burns bituminous coal at lower burners and subbituminous coal at upper burners gives the least carbon in ash. For two blending methods, carbon in ash is mainly attributed to the middle burner sets in the furnace. The field tests at a 500 MW coal-fired power plant showed that the in-furnace blending method substantially reduces in NOx and carbon in ash, compared with the out-furnace blending method. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This experimental study examined a low-emission steam boiler in which the filtration combustion technology was employed. This new boiler concept is consisted of a reciprocal flow porous burner, in which a combustion wave propagates along the reactor length. The boiler's burner is filled up by an inert porous material, which leads to a stable burning of ultra-lean fuel/air mixtures, operating below flammability limits of conventional burners. In reciprocal filtration combustion, the reaction zone travels back and forth along the length of the burner, maintaining a typical trapezoidal temperature distribution favorable to the energy extraction. Embedding heat exchangers into the ends of the porous bed results in an alternative low-emission high-efficiency boiler. The heat re-circulation inside the porous matrix and the low degree of thermal non-equilibrium between the gas and the solid phases result in ultra-low levels of CO and NO. x. Over an equivalence ratio range from 0.20 to 1.0 and a gas flow velocity range from 0.2 to 0.6. m/s, burning the technical methane, the developed prototype has reached efficiencies superior to 90{\%} and NO. x and CO emission levels lower than 1.0 and 0.5. ppm, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

F and between 1 and 100 atmospheres. The molar ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen employed is controlled at from about 0.6:1 to about 1.2:1 to control the CO production and also to maintain the molten salt at a desired operating temperature. Sulfur and ash introduced with the fuel are retained in the molten salt. The gaseous effluent, containing a molar ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide substantially greater than one, is reacted in a water gas shift reaction, followed by removal of the carbon dioxide present in the gaseous effluent from the shift reaction to produce the synthesis gas, capable of being reacted further under appropriate conditions to produce pipeline gas, methanol, ammonia, or gasoline. At least a portion of the removed carbon dioxide is recycled for admixture with the oxygen to form the feed gas to the molten salt containing the carbonaceous material.},

@article{Bellais2007a,
abstract = {Wood is an interesting alternative to fossil fuels. It is CO2-neutral and widely available. However it is a difficult fuel to handle which features a low energy content. Thus technologies for wood thermal conversion need to be improved. This work concerns the development of a comprehensive two-dimensional mathematical model describing the pyrolysis of large wood particles and its implementation in a Fortran program. The model has been continuously tested and improved by experimental results obtained in a reactor for single particle pyrolysis (SPAR) at the Division of Physical Chemistry at G{\"{o}}teborg University. The first part of the thesis (Paper I) presents a kinetic study of the pyrolysis of large wood particles, based on experiments carried out in the SPAR. Three pyrolysis kinetic schemes were selected for later inclusion in a model featuring heat and mass transfer. Paper II concerns the addition of a sub-model for heat and mass transfer to the three kinetic schemes. The resulting model for large wood particles has been tested against experiments in the SPAR. A scheme based on two competing reactions developed from experiments at low temperature pyrolysis in the SPAR was found to perform well but its empirical nature limits its validity to the experimental conditions of the SPAR. A scheme from the literature based on TGA experiments appeared promising, especially when planning to enhance it with secondary reactions. Paper III deals with the development of shrinkage models for 2D cylindrical particles. The predicted mass loss, size variation and surface temperature were tested against experiments carried out in the SPAR. The shrinkage does not affect the pyrolysis rate or the surface temperature in the conditions prevailing in the SPAR. Paper IV investigates the influence of different shrinkage models and the geometry on the heating rate of a shrinking particle. Shrinkage influences the heating rate positively by increasing the conductive heat flow and negatively by decreasing the surface area of the particle. Therefore the net effect of shrinkage on the heating rate depends on the particle geometry and the location of shrinkage. Paper V studies three different models for wood drying under pyrolysis conditions. The predicted surface temperature and global drying rate were compared with experimental results from pyrolysis experiments of wet particles in the SPAR. A model based on a first order kinetic evaporation rate was found to be the most interesting because of the quality of the prediction of the drying rate and the ease of implementation.},

A single filtration velocity (12 cm/s) was used and the mixture equivalence ratio was varied from 1 to 3.5. The air and oxidizer content were adjusted to retain the filtration velocity constant for each equivalence ratio. Six oxidizer compositions (10{\%}, 15{\%}, 21{\%}, 25{\%}, 30{\%}, and 35{\%} O2) were comparatively analyzed focusing on combustion temperatures, combustion wave velocities, major and minor products of combustion. The studied range of equivalence ratios covered the underadiabatic (upstream) and superadiabatic (downstream) regimes of transient filtration waves where combustion temperatures are less than and greater than adiabatic temperatures, respectively.},

abstract = {In the present work, the thermal efficiency of a conventional domestic burner is studied both experimentally and numerically for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and piped natural gas (PNG) fuels. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling of the steady-state flow, combustion and heat transfer to the vessel is reported for the first time in such burners. Based on the insights from the CFD model concerning the flow and heat transfer, design modifications in the form of a circular insert and a radiant sheet are proposed which are observed to increase thermal efficiency for LPG. For PNG, predictions showed that loading height was a much more important factor affecting efficiency than these design modifications and an optimal loading height could be identified. Experiments confirm these trends by showing an improvement in burner thermal efficiency of 2.5{\%} for LPG with the modified design, and 10{\%} for PNG with the optimal loading height, demonstrating that the CFD modeling approach developed in the present work is a useful tool to study domestic burners. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Selective capture of CO(2), which is essential for natural gas purification and CO(2) sequestration, has been reported in zeolites, porous membranes, and amine solutions. However, all such systems require substantial energy input for release of captured CO(2), leading to low energy efficiency and high cost. A new class of materials named metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has also been demonstrated to take up voluminous amounts of CO(2). However, these studies have been largely limited to equilibrium uptake measurements, which are a poor predictor of separation ability, rather than the more industrially relevant kinetic (dynamic) capacity. Here, we report that a known MOF, Mg-MOF-74, with open magnesium sites, rivals competitive materials in CO(2) capture, with 8.9 wt. {\%} dynamic capacity, and undergoes facile CO(2) release at significantly lower temperature, 80 degrees C. Mg-MOF-74 offers an excellent balance between dynamic capacity and regeneration. These results demonstrate the potential of MOFs with open metal sites as efficient CO(2) capture media.},

@article{Bushell2002,
abstract = {A review is presented of a number of techniques available for the characterisation of the structure of aggregates formed from suspensions of sub-micron particles. Amongst the experimental techniques that have been commonly used are scattering (light, X-ray or neutron), settling and imaging and these are the focus of this work. The theoretical basis for the application of fractal geometry to characterisation of flocs and aggregates is followed by a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the above techniques. Of the scattering techniques available, light scattering provides the greatest potential for use as a tool for structure characterisation even though interpretation of the scattered intensity pattern is complicated by the strong interaction of light and matter. Restructuring further complicates the analysis. Although settling has long been used to characterise particle behaviour, the absence of an accurate permeability model limits the technique as a means of determining the porosity of fractal aggregates. However, it can be argued that the determination of fractal dimension is relatively unaffected. The strength of image analysis lies in its ability to provide a great deal of information about particle morphology and the weaknesses lie in the difficulties with image processing and sample size as this is a particle counting technique. There are very few papers which compare the fractal dimension measured by more than one technique. Light scattering potentially provides a useful tool for checking settling results. However, further work is required to develop proper models for aggregate permeability and flow-through effects.},

@article{Chaturvedi2014,
abstract = {Direct expansion solar assisted heat pump systems (DX-SAHP) have been widely used in many applications including water heating. In the DX-SAHP systems the solar collector and the heat pump evaporator are integrated into a single unit in order to transfer the solar energy to the refrigerant. The present work is aimed at studying the use of the DX-SAHP for low temperature water heating applications. The novel aspect of this paper involves a detailed long-term thermo-economic analysis of the energy conservation potential and economic viability of these systems. The thermal performance is simulated using a computer program that incorporates location dependent radiation, collector, economic, heat pump and load data. The economic analysis is performed using the life cycle cost (LCC) method. Results indicate that the DX-SAHP water heaters systems when compared to the conventional electrical water heaters are both economical as well as energy conserving. The analysis also reveals that the minimum value of the system life cycle cost is achieved at optimal values of the solar collector area as well as the compressor displacement capacity. Since the cost of SAHP system presents a barrier to mass scale commercialization, the results of the present study indicating that the SAHP life cycle cost can be minimized by optimizing the collector area would certainly be helpful in lowering, if not eliminating, the economic barrier to these systems. Also, at load temperatures higher than 70 C, the performance of the single stage heat pump degrades to the extent that its cost and efficiency advantages over the electric only system are lost. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Because solar energy is available in large excess relative to current rates of energy consumption, effective conversion of this renewable yet intermittent resource into a transportable and dispatchable chemical fuel may ensure the goal of a sustainable energy future. However, low conversion efficiencies, particularly with CO(2) reduction, as well as utilization of precious materials have limited the practical generation of solar fuels. By using a solar cavity-receiver reactor, we combined the oxygen uptake and release capacity of cerium oxide and facile catalysis at elevated temperatures to thermochemically dissociate CO(2) and H(2)O, yielding CO and H(2), respectively. Stable and rapid generation of fuel was demonstrated over 500 cycles. Solar-to-fuel efficiencies of 0.7 to 0.8{\%} were achieved and shown to be largely limited by the system scale and design rather than by chemistry.},

@article{Cornejo2011,
abstract = {A three-dimensional computational model was developed to describe the coal-gasification processes inside fluidized-bed reactors. The commercial multi-purpose CFD code FLUENT 6.3 was employed, taking into account drying, volatilization, combustion and gasification processes. Both gas phase and solid phase were described using a eulerian approach to model the exchanges of mass, energy and momentum between phases. The disperse phase was described using the kinetic theory of granular flows. The chemical model involved five heterogeneous and five homogeneous chemical reactions, tracking seven species in the gas phase (CO2, CO, H(2)O, CH(4), H(2), O(2) and N(2)) and one specie in the solid phase (C((s))). Drying and volatilization rates were estimated by mass conservation. Heterogeneous reaction-rates were determined by combining an Arrhenius kinetic-rate and a diffusion rate using the kinetics/diffusion Surface Reaction Model; the model was implemented within FLUENT through UDFs (User Defined Functions). Homogeneous reaction-rates were described by a turbulent mixing rate using the Eddy Dissipation Model available in FLUENT. Calibration and validation were performed by using existing experimental data from a benchmark coal-gasification case available in the literature. Results are in good agreement with experimental data, capturing known phenomena like fluidization-bed height, temperature distribution and species concentrations. The main contribution of the present work was implementing the necessary sub-models within the FLUENT code in order to handle reactive fluidized-beds in complex geometries. This allowed combining the flexibility of a commercial CFD code with the accuracy of simplified models developed in academic frameworks.},

@article{Cossio2012,
abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},
